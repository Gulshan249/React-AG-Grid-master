  - Make the necessary changes to the information. Changes are saved automatically once you click outside the cell or press Enter.
  - The table will update immediately to reflect your changes.

- Filter Users
  - Each column in the table has a filter box at the top.
  - Click on the filter box of the column you want to filter.
  - Choose the filter option you need from the dropdown list. Options include:
  - Contains: Shows rows where the column contains the specified text.

  - Does Not Equal: Shows rows where the column does not match the specified text.
  - Blank: Shows rows where the column is empty.
  - Not Blank: Shows rows where the column is not empty.
  - Enter the text or select the criteria you want to filter by.
